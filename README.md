We wanted a way to help fellow Canadians decrease their carbon emission consumption and we thought we could create a model to do exactly that and use ML to optimize it!

About the project:
- Uses Toronto weather data and building energy consumption over the past 50 years to predict how changing temperatures could affect the heating and cooling operations of buildings
- Enables users to view a time range in the future and receive energy saving and management tips in response to estimated temperatures at the time

The process:
- Utilized a weather API to create a dataset that was then parsed using Python ML libraries (`pandas` and `numpy`)
- Implemented a ML-based Random Forest Regressor (via `scikit-learn`) to predict the weather in future years and how that might affect carbon emissions due to heating and cooling in buildings
